This is an introduction to Meteor for programing beginners.

##Introduction

##**What is Meteor?**

###
Meteor is a full-stack JavaScript platform for developing **modern web and mobile applications**. Meteor includes a key set of technologies for building connected-client reactive applications, a build tool, and a curated set of packages from the Node.js and general JavaScript community.

 * Meteor allows you to **develop in one language**, JavaScript, in all environments: application server, web browser, and mobile device.

 * Meteor uses data on the wire, meaning the server sends data, not HTML, and the client renders it. (Other words: Meteor maintains state via DDP i.e sockets. A simple protocol for fetching structured data from a server, and receiving live updates when that data changes.)

 * Meteor **embraces the ecosystem**, bringing the best parts of the extremely active JavaScript community to you in a careful and considered way.

 * Meteor provides **full stack reactivity**, allowing your UI to seamlessly reflect the true state of the world with minimal development effort.

 In the Meteor platform, Meteor clients talk to Meteor servers over DDP. But the Meteor client doesn't know that it's talking to a Meteor server; it just knows that it's speaking DDP. Likewise, the Meteor server doesn't know that it's talking to a Meteor client.

##**Why use Meteor?**

###

* RADICALLY LESS CODE

Accomplish in 10 lines what would otherwise take 1000, thanks to a reactive programming model that extends all the way from the database to the user's screen.

* UNIVERSAL JAVASCRIPT

The same code runs from the client to the cloud, from packages to database APIs. The same code runs cross browsers and mobile devices via Meteor's unified Isobuild system.

* MOBILE AND WEB

A great experience both as an installable iOS and Android app, and as a web app that loads on demand.

* FULLY INTEGRATED AND FLEXIBLE

Meteor’s integrated stack means you don’t have to spend time managing and integrating components and code. You can focus on building your app. And with Meteor’s package system, you can plug in thousands of libraries with additional functionality.

* REACTIVE RENDERING

Client GUI components provide the look, feel and response of a thick client app using Meteor's Blaze framework or integrating with AngularJS and ReactJS.

##**Cons of Meteor**

* When you’re building a website not a web application

* Scalability

* Meteor out of the box uses MongoDB, though they are working on official support for other databases

##**Your Choice!**
